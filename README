# Cmake file included, must have cmake installed.
# Alternatively you can download Clion IDE from Jetbrains and import, or import into any other IDE that takes understands Cmake
#
# You will have to copy into your cmake folder the findSOIL.cmake file that I have provided in the zip file.
# 
# I've included a video with the location that the .cmake file will need to be copied into, if you are using the CLION IDE that I specified above. There is also a video demonstrating the program functionality just in case.
#
# Im using the SOIL library for loading the textures images. You will have to download that library as well.
# On ubuntu the package is libsoil-dev.
#
#
# sudo apt-get install libsoil-dev
#
# mkdir build
# cd build/
# cmake ../
# make
# ./graphics
